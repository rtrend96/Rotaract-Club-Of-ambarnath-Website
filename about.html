										<h1>What is Rotaract?</h1>
										<p>
										Rotaract is the most exciting youth organization in the world, working with Rotary International . Today there are over 155,000 members across more than 148 countries. We organize projects or events in different avenues of service. Our mission is to enhance personality of members and serve the community in the process.

									<h4>Organization Structures</h4>
									<p>	
									Rotaract as an organisation is voluntary. The structure gives amazing freedom to individual clubs to plan and organise projects at individual level. Every Rotaract Club is sponsored by a Rotary Club, which is the Parent Body and without their support of a Rotaract Club has no meaning. On top is Rotary International with its headquarters in US.
                                      </p>
									  <ul>
                                     <li>Rotary International is the main body.</li>
                                      <li> Then, Rotary Clubs all over the world are constituents of RI</li>
                                    <li> Rotaract, Interact and Innerwheel are associated with the above individual Rotary Clubs.</li>
                                     <li>Every Rotaract Club is sponsored by a Rotary Club</li>
                                      <li> The First Six Chartered Clubs in India:</li>
									   </ul>
									   <ol>
									   <li> Rotaract Club of Secunderabad: 2nd April 1968.</li>
                                      <li> Rotaract Club of Tanjore: 16th May 1968.</li>
                                       <li> Rotaract Club of Patna: 20th May 1968.</li>
                                        <li>Rotaract Club of Bijnor: 3rd June 1968.</li>
                                        <li>Rotaract Club of Ambernath: 6th August 1968.</li>
                                        <li>Rotaract Club of Hyderabad: 3rd September</li>
                                    </ol>
									<h4>What we do?</h4>
									<p>We organise events. Thats it. Simple, ain't it ? But the way of organising and administration is what makes Rotaract exciting The projects that we organise are categorised into four avenues :</p>
<ol>
    <li>Club Services : If it's fun you desire, then Club Services would be your cuppa tea, since this is where the club lets their hair down and goes all out to enjoy themselves. Life is tough and grim and without club services, maintaining sanity is a trifle tough. This is rewarding in terms of personal contacts, increased interaction between members of the same club, and between different clubs too. This is as much a part of the Rotaract club as anything else, since all work and no play makes.... (well... you know that).</li>
    <li>Community Services : This is what most people see as the public face of Rotaract. This is quite an important facet of the club but by no measure of anyone's imagination is this avenue the most dominating of all event avenues. Activities under this head include Vaccinations, Education Drives, Awareness Camps, and Lecture Series.</li>
    <li>International Services : This is considered the glam part of Rotaract services, and is too. International exchanges, education crossovers, culture visit exchanges, and other international events ( By international, we include all events happening outside Bangalore) comprise this avenue. A great way to visit other cultures, to experience newer sights and sounds, and to enrich your value system.</li>
    <li>Professional Services : This avenue is for all those students who are undecided about their careers, and for those career people who need updates / honing of skills to stay competent in their line of business. Lecture Series, Workshops, Career Guidance, Self-Improvement Courses, etc are some project ideas that are part of this avenue. </li>
	                                 <p>
									 The projects or events are planned and organised by a team selected from the Club itself who have the responsibility of the project right from the planning stage till the execution. There are projects organised beyond the Club level meaning - organised by more than one club coming together which are joint projects or District projects. Such projects are a platform to know more people and interact with them.
